Testing multiple FPGAs

use Morgan Stanley testplan from https://github.com/morganstanley/testplan

testplan is not available at PYPI so build wheel and add to PYPI to make it available

"An FPGA image provides the actual FPGA resource utilization of your design (ALMs, DSPs, and so on) and can be run on FPGA hardware to collect performance measurements for further analysis."
